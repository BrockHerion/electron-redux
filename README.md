# Electron & Redux Demo

This is a simple example of using Redux Toolkit with Electron. To run this app, download the repository and run

```sh
npm install
```

After that, all you need to do to start the app is run

```sh
npm start
```

You should see a simple, small window open with a basic counter on it.
